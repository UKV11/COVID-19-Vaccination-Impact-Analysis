# COVID-19-Vaccination-Impact-Analysis
Project Overview
This project investigates the correlation between COVID-19 vaccination rates and the number of new 
cases and deaths recorded in various countries during the year 2022. The analysis is essential for 
understanding the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns and can provide valuable insights for 
policymakers and public health officials.
Research Questions
1. How do changes in COVID-19 vaccination rates correlate with changes in new cases 
amongdifferent countries in 2022?
2. How do changes in COVID-19 vaccination rates correlate with changes in deaths among 
differentcountries in 2022?
Methodology
- Data Preprocessing: Involves cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Includes generating descriptive statistics, visualizingrelationships, 
and identifying patterns.
- Regression Analysis: Employs multiple linear regression models to examine the relationshipbetween 
vaccination rates and COVID-19 outcomes.
- Time-Series Analysis: Utilizes ARIMA models to analyze temporal patterns in the data.
Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the 'owid-covid-data.csv', sourced from Our World in Data.
Key Results
- Identified significant correlations between vaccination rates and reductions in COVID-19 cases 
anddeaths.
- Highlighted country-specific differences in the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns.
Conclusion
This analysis provides a data-driven approach to understanding the impact of COVID-19 vaccination 
on public health outcomes globally. The findings can guide future vaccination strategies and public 
health policies.
